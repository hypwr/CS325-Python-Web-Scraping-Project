Tax preparation costs have risen significantly due to labor shortages and inflation. DIY tax software and accounting fees have increased by 8.3%, and some consumers are facing higher costs even when using "free" filing options. The IRS is offering a new Direct File option for free federal returns in some states, but major tax software providers oppose it. Despite criticism, TurboTax and H&R Block remain popular options, with prices that have remained unchanged or increased slightly.
