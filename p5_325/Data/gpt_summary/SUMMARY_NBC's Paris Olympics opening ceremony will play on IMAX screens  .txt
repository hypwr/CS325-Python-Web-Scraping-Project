NBCUniversal will present the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony live in IMAX theaters, offering viewers a cinematic experience on over 150 screens in the US. The ceremony will showcase athletes on a flotilla along the River Seine, marking the first opening ceremony held outside a stadium. IMAX's successful run with "Dune: Part Two" and the potential for premium ticket prices and additional revenue through advertising make the partnership promising for both NBC and IMAX.
