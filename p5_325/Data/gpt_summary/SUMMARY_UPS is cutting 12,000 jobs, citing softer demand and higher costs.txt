UPS will cut 12,000 jobs, about 2.4% of its workforce, due to lower demand and higher labor costs. The cuts will occur globally in all functions, with 75% happening in the first half of 2023. Union-represented roles are not affected. UPS reported lower-than-expected revenue and saw its stock price drop significantly following the announcement.
