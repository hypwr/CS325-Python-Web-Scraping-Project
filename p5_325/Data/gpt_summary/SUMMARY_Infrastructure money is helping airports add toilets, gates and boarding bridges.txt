Congress and the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is providing funding for airport upgrades, including terminal improvements, baggage systems, and accessibility enhancements. While airports appreciate the funding, they note that it is insufficient to address their long-term infrastructure needs. The grants are having a broader impact by improving smaller airports, which can benefit larger hubs. However, airports rely on various funding sources, including airline rentals, fees, and loans, to finance upgrades.
