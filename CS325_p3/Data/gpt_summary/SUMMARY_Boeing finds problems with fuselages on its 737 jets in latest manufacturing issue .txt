Boeing has discovered misdrilled holes in the fuselages of 50 undelivered 737 jets, delaying deliveries. The holes were discovered by a supplier, and while not an immediate safety issue, they require rework. This latest quality issue comes after scrutiny over a door plug blowout on a Max 9 and subsequent grounding.
