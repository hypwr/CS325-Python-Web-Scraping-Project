The 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony will be broadcast live in IMAX theaters, making it the first Olympics to take place outside a stadium. The event will showcase athletes on a flotilla down the River Seine, with ticket prices yet to be announced. IMAX's unique cinematic experience and premium pricing could entice moviegoers, driving interest in the company's stock, which is currently undervalued according to analysts.
