# Project 3
## By Josh Erwin
### Overview
Project 3 adds the addition of AI summarization through the Gemini API. This program asks the AI, "Please take the following article and summarize it in 50 words or less, here is the article: " followed by the article content. This question can be changed as one sees fit.
One major thing you must do to use the program is navigate to the 'module1' folder and open the GeminiAPI.py file. At the top of this file, you will see a variable called GOOGLE_API_KEY. This variable should be set equal to your Google API key. To get a Google API key for free (assuming your Google account does not already have one) go to "https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/get_started_web". Then scroll down until you see the box "Get an API key". Follow its directs and then once you have a key, copy and paste the key into the quoted area on the GOOGLE_API_KEY variable.
Please remember to update your requirements.yml as this was changed during this section of the project.
